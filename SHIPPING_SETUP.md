# Shipping Module Setup Guide

The shipping module has been completely rebuilt with full functionality. Here's how to set it up:

## 1. Apply Database Migration

**IMPORTANT**: Apply the shipping system migration to create the required database tables.

### Option A: Via Supabase Studio (Recommended)
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/tcwzhkeqwymqrljaadew/sql/new
2. Copy and paste the entire contents of `supabase/migrations/20250923191701_shipping_system.sql`
3. Click "Run" to execute the migration

### Option B: Via CLI (if connectivity works)
```bash
SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN="sbp_c6ac77ad960c391d02e50a7c8690e4d3bca081f3" SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD="pCEOUeoTA0xTtt2Y" ~/.local/bin/supabase db push --linked
```

## 2. Configure ShipStation API

1. Navigate to Settings > Shipping in the ERP system
2. Click "Configure" button
3. Enter your ShipStation API credentials:
   - **API Key**: Your ShipStation API key
   - **API Secret**: Your ShipStation API secret
4. Configure auto-sync settings if desired
5. Click "Save Configuration"

### How to get ShipStation API Credentials:
1. Log into your ShipStation account
2. Go to Account Settings > API Settings
3. Generate new API Key and Secret
4. Copy both values into the ERP configuration

## 3. Test the System

### Manual Sync Test
1. Click "Sync Yesterday's Shipments" button
2. The system will:
   - Fetch all shipments from yesterday
   - Match SKUs to your inventory
   - Create pending deduction records
   - Show results

### Processing Deductions
1. Review pending deductions in the list
2. Click "Process Deduction" to update inventory
3. Or click "Ignore" to skip items that shouldn't affect inventory

## 4. What the System Does

### Daily Sync Process:
1. **Fetches ShipStation Data**: Gets all shipments for a specific date
2. **SKU Matching**: Compares shipped SKUs to your inventory items
3. **Aggregation**: Combines quantities by SKU across all orders for the day
4. **Cost Calculation**: Uses weighted average cost from inventory
5. **Duplicate Prevention**: Tracks processed orders to prevent re-processing
6. **Creates Pending Records**: Generates deduction records for approval

### Inventory Deduction:
1. **Approval Required**: All deductions must be manually approved
2. **Inventory Updates**: Reduces `quantity_on_hand` for matched SKUs
3. **Audit Trail**: Creates inventory transaction records
4. **Cost Tracking**: Records total cost of goods shipped

## 5. Database Tables Created

The migration creates these tables:

- **`shipping_deductions`**: Daily aggregated shipment data
- **`shipping_deduction_items`**: Individual SKU line items
- **`processed_shipstation_orders`**: Duplicate prevention tracking
- **`shipstation_config`**: API configuration storage

## 6. Key Features

### ✅ Real ShipStation Integration
- Live API connection to ShipStation
- Fetches actual shipment data
- Handles pagination automatically

### ✅ Smart SKU Matching
- Matches ShipStation SKUs to inventory items
- Handles fulfillment SKUs and regular SKUs
- Identifies unknown/drop-ship items

### ✅ Duplicate Prevention
- Tracks processed ShipStation order IDs
- Prevents re-processing same orders
- Date-based sync protection

### ✅ Inventory Deduction
- Uses weighted average cost
- Updates quantity on hand
- Creates audit trail transactions

### ✅ Approval Workflow
- All deductions require manual approval
- Preview before processing
- Ability to ignore irrelevant items

### ✅ Error Handling
- Comprehensive error catching
- Fallback mechanisms
- Clear status reporting

## 7. Business Logic

### Daily Aggregation Example:
If ShipStation shows these shipments for one day:
- Order #1001: 2x SKU-ABC, 1x SKU-DEF
- Order #1002: 3x SKU-ABC
- Order #1003: 1x SKU-DEF, 2x SKU-XYZ

The system creates ONE deduction record with:
- SKU-ABC: 5 total (across 2 orders)
- SKU-DEF: 2 total (across 2 orders)
- SKU-XYZ: 2 total (across 1 order)

### Cost Calculation:
- Uses weighted average cost from inventory table
- Calculates total cost = quantity × unit cost
- Only deducts items found in your inventory

## 8. Testing Workflow

1. **Setup**: Apply migration + configure API keys
2. **Sync**: Run "Sync Yesterday's Shipments"
3. **Review**: Check the pending deduction created
4. **Process**: Click "Process Deduction" to update inventory
5. **Verify**: Check inventory quantities were reduced
6. **Audit**: Review inventory transaction records

## 9. Troubleshooting

### "No ShipStation configuration found"
- Configure API keys in Settings > Shipping

### "Connection failed"
- Verify API key and secret are correct
- Check ShipStation account has API access enabled

### "Date already synced"
- Each date can only be synced once
- Delete existing deduction record to re-sync

### "No inventory items found"
- Ensure your products have matching SKUs in inventory table
- Check that SKUs in ShipStation match exactly

## 10. Production Considerations

### Auto-Sync Setup:
- Enable "automatic daily sync" in configuration
- Set appropriate sync hour (e.g., 8 AM)
- System will auto-sync when users load the page

### Data Retention:
- Processed orders are tracked permanently
- Deduction records kept for audit purposes
- Configure backup strategy for shipping data

### Performance:
- Large ShipStation accounts may need batching
- Monitor sync times for optimization
- Consider async processing for high volumes

The shipping module is now fully functional with real ShipStation integration, smart inventory deduction, and comprehensive error handling. It will dramatically improve your inventory accuracy by automatically tracking shipments.
